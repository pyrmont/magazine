## History

### The Short Version

**_inqk_** is a magazine written by [Michael Camilleri][me]. There are no issues and articles are published on an irregular basis. There are four topics.

That's pretty much it.

### The Long Version

For a long time I was unhappy with my blog. Two people I greatly admired, [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/) and [Merlin Mann](http://www.merlinmann.com/), had given an [acclaimed talk](http://www.43folders.com/2009/03/25/blogs-turbocharged) back in 2009 that explained that the formula for a successful blog was _obsession + topic + voice_. That seemed simple. I could do that.

Except I couldn't. I could never seem to settle on a particular topic. Sometimes I wanted to write about things that happened to me, sometimes I wanted to offer an opinion on a development in the technology industry, sometimes I felt compelled to comment on a social issue. I didn't want to run a separate blog for each area of interest but they felt too disparate for any overarching idea to connect them together.

Partly, I feel as if this is a function of who I am. When I was at school, I studied a broad range of subjects. I enjoyed deriving answers to questions in mathematics and physics as much as I enjoyed debating the significance of historical events and works of literature. When I went to university, I studied law and computer science, desperate to engage both halves of my brain. I am constitutionally incapable of only thinking about one type of thing.

So I muddled on, writing posts when I felt I had to, but always being disappointed with the mish mash that resulted. Often I questioned whether something 'made sense' for me to write about. Sometimes I didn't write instead.

One day I realised that the magazines I most enjoyed reading -- _The New Yorker_, _The Monthly_, _The New Republic_, _The Economist_ -- didn't just focus on one topic. 'Why were they allowed to cover multiple points of interest?', I thought. It just seemed accepted that that's the way things are done when it comes to magazines. I mean, it's obvious, right? Magazines involve a group of writers, pooling their work together. Since it's a group, it stands to reason that the articles will deal with a range of topics.

The thing was I found that if I thought of my blog as a 'magazine', even though nothing else had changed, I wasn't upset by the lack of consistency. It just felt natural. It was a magazine after all. That's the way things are done.

And so a conceit was born. I decided I would call what I was doing a magazine. And why not? Why can't one person write a magazine? Why does a magazine need to have issues? The entire media industry is in flux thanks to the Internet and I don't see why the definition of what constitutes a magazine couldn't be in flux too.

And so I created **_inqk_**. It's a magazine written by [Michael Camilleri][me]. There are no issues and articles are published on an irregular basis. There are four topics.

That's really it.

## Acknowledgements

There are three people whom I particularly want to mention.

I owe a great debt to Aaron Swartz. His lack of fear in writing about whatever interested him, as well as the way he separated [his blog](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/) from what he called [his quoteblog](http://qblog.aaronsw.com/), serves as a constant inspiration. I have also taken the liberty of borrowing small design cues from his site (although I didn't notice that the background colours were almost identical until well after finishing the initial design in Photoshop). I can only say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. The world is a less brilliant place without him.

I am also indebted to Thomas Reynolds and the other developers that work on [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/). You can't see it from where you're sitting but if you enjoy reading this, I can assure you that you are benefiting from their efforts.

Finally, I would like to thank John Gruber. All of the pages on **_inqk_** are written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and without its existence, I'm not sure I could be bothered to do this at all.

## Legal

I have strong feelings about the public domain. For reasons that are explained in more detail in this [post](2012/public-domain.html), I have put all original work that I have created on this site into the public domain. It's appreciated if you appropriately credit me but not necessary.
