# About This Project

## What is this?
**_inqk_** is a magazine written by [Michael Camilleri][me]. There are no issues and articles are published on an irregular basis. There are four topics.

## Isn't this just a blog?

Yes, and no.

Over time blog has come to mean a website with a focus on a particular area or topic (with occasional forays permitted if not condoned). Since I wanted to write about more than one area and since you seem to be allowed to do this if you call yourself a magazine, I'm borrowing the term.

## What's with the public domain thing?

For the reasons expressed in [this post](/2012/public-domain.html) on my previous weblog, I have disclaimed all rights I may have in relation to the content on this site and put all original work into the public domain. You're welcome to use it however you like.
